# PyTorch Fundamentals

This repository contains a comprehensive set of PyTorch exercises and examples, designed to take you from the basics of tensor operations to advanced topics in neural network classification and computer vision.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into four main modules:

1. **0_FirstModule**: Introduction to PyTorch basics and tensor operations
2. **1_WorkflowFundamentals**: Core concepts of the PyTorch workflow
3. **2_NeuralNetworkClassification**: Neural network models for classification tasks
4. **3_ComputerVision**: Computer vision tasks using PyTorch

Each module contains its own README with detailed information about the topics covered and the files included.

## Learning Path

This repository is structured to provide a progressive learning experience:

1. Start with **0_FirstModule** to get familiar with PyTorch tensors and basic operations.
2. Move on to **1_WorkflowFundamentals** to learn about creating, training, and evaluating models.
3. Explore **2_NeuralNetworkClassification** to dive into classification tasks and more complex model architectures.
4. Finally, tackle **3_ComputerVision** to apply your knowledge to image-based tasks.

## Key Features

- Hands-on exercises and examples
- Progression from basic to advanced topics
- Focus on practical implementation
- Coverage of common deep learning errors and best practices
- Device-agnostic code (works on both CPU and GPU)
