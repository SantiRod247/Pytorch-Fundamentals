# 1_WorkflowFundamentals

This folder contains PyTorch exercises and examples focusing on the fundamentals of the PyTorch workflow, covering the following topics:

1. **Linear Regression Model**
   - Creating a simple linear regression model
   - Generating synthetic data
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets

2. **Model Creation and Training**
   - Defining a custom `LinearRegressionModel` class
   - Implementing forward pass
   - Setting up loss function and optimizer
   - Training loop implementation

3. **Model Evaluation and Prediction**
   - Evaluating model performance
   - Making predictions on test data
   - Comparing learned parameters with original values

4. **Model Saving and Loading**
   - Saving trained model state dict
   - Loading model state dict into a new instance
   - Verifying loaded model predictions

5. **Device-Agnostic Code**
   - Implementing code that works on both CPU and GPU
   - Moving model and data to the appropriate device

6. **Exercises**
   - Creating custom datasets
   - Building and training models from scratch
   - Implementing full training and evaluation workflows

These exercises provide a comprehensive understanding of the PyTorch workflow, from data preparation to model deployment, and serve as a foundation for more advanced deep learning projects.
